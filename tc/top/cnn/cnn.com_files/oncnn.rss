      <title>Bus full of Hockey players goes off Trans Canada</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-55593?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>Just before noon today a Trius Tour bus full of Hockey players
heading to Boston went off the Trans Canada highway between
Memramcook exit 480 and Moncton. The 52 yr old driver of the bus
was taken by hospital with chest pains , he has cardiac history and
is a diabetic. I talked to one of the hockey players that was
sitting right behind the driver and he said they were going down
the highway and watching tv and next thing he knew they were
hitting the ditch the bus did come up on one side but once it hit
the mud in the ditch it came back down on the wheels and skidded
for quite a ways before coming to a stop. Memramcook Fire Dept and
many volunteers were on the scene fast. Road conditions at the time
were wet, as it was raining .</description>

      <title>Bobcat attack</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-55414?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>While it's not a great picture, it is rather hard to hold down a
rabid bobcat with one hand and take a picture with the other. To be
brief in the story, I heard a woman screaming behind my apartments,
ran down to see what was happening and she, along with her two
dogs, had been attacked by a bobcat. When I arrived, Elaine was not
only holding the bobcat down, but also holding one of her dogs on
the leash at the time, I helped her out and another person who
heard the cries (Cindy), came to help also. We all came out with
pretty minor injuries, Elaine got the brunt of it with several
bites and scratches, and we all needed to receive rabies shots as
the animal was rabid. One thing that I did learn out of all of this
was that the rabies shots are nothing to be afraid of as they are
not nearly as bad as people say that they are. I realize that this
is 'old news' now, but there is one people that I'd like for people
to realize, rabies shots are pretty painless and they are a 100%
cure to a disease that is 100% fatal...</description>

      <title>K2 Info Potentially Inaccurate</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-55456?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>I spent the summer of 07 in Pakistan attempting K2 via the Cesen
Route with 9 other American climbers. It is an intense and "full
on" mountain experience. No one goes there with the intent of
dying-yet climbers are oftentimes surprised to find out they are in
fact REPORTED dead.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; LIke it or not one of the great things about K2 and the
majority of the Karakoram region is that it is in fact remote.
Something that is very difficult to find in such an "overpopulated"
world. Even the most hightech SAT phones can have less than average
success rates when trying to reach loved ones back home.
&lt;br /&gt;During our American expedition last year we went very Low
Tech to say the least. No lap tops, digital messaging equipment,
generators, or even the expected SAT phone in the group. To some
degree this was because the remoteness of K2 is part of the appeal.
&lt;br /&gt;This year I was again supposed to be participating in another
K2 expedition with a much smaller but more Tech Savvy group. 
&lt;a
href="http://www.k2tallmountain.com/"&gt;http://www.k2tallmountain.com/&lt;/a&gt;
New work obligations caused me to cancel my reservation with the
team at the last minute, and I wish them luck as they are now
headed to K2 Basecamp from the neighboring Broad Peak Basecamp.
Even the more advanced team with their hightech gadgets hasn't been
able to email anything out since the start of their expedition in
June.
&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, one of the few constants in my
expedition to K2 last season-aside from the avalanches(a couple
pictured)- was the amount of "disinformation" that floated around
Basecamp on a daily basis. 
&lt;br /&gt;Often the "disinformation" originated from LO's-(Liason
Officers from the Pakistani Military that each expedition is
required to have accompany them)-who would regularly visit with one
another's camp for tea or meals oftentimes travelling back and
forth between both expedition parties and K2/Broad Peak Basecamps. 
&lt;br /&gt;This also needs to be prefaced with the oft overlooked fact
that communication between expedition parties is sometimes limited
to the communication between it's LO's due to language barriers.
So, "Lost in Translation" takes on a whole new meaning in these
instances.
&lt;br /&gt;Never was there any mal intent in the reporting of "yet
another climber having died" on this route or that. In fact,
sometimes the vagaries of the reports would lead to not one, but
two climbers missing and assumed dead from a particular partly when
if fact no one was dead. It was instead a case of frozen or dead
radio batteries not allowing that climber to communicate with their
team. 
&lt;br /&gt;After having taken numerous calls today wondering if I was in
fact on any expeditions in the Karakoram as planned, I started
searching the net. In four different articles I found four
different accounts of "how many" and "who was confirmed", none of
which with definitive details and all of which rimed with "suspect"
info due to the mixture of teams and nationalities involved.
&lt;br /&gt;Last season on the hike to K2 Basecamp we were resting at
Camp Joula when we heard the bustle of an Italian girl needing a
rescue. Only to have an Italian team member rush into our cook tent
to tell us "we have a dead girl" and that "she needs meds".
Obviously those two are mutually exclusive as no dead person needs
meds. It was a simple miscommunication and admittedly if I needed
to rush into the Italian tent and tell them in their native tongue
that we needed particular medical help-well it really wouldn't
happen and I've been to Italy twice. Panic has a way of making the
simple complex. 
&lt;br /&gt;In the end the girl survived after an emergency Helicopter
evac to Skardu. Probably only her team actually knows what
necessitated the evac as we heard that it was everything from Heat
Stroke to Appendicitis. 
&lt;br /&gt;The language barrier between teams however was/is never
really overcome in these arenas of international climbing. It is a
great place to partner with other great climbers and religious and
political differences are checked at the tent door as everyone is
struggling to survive, much less climb one of the toughest
mountains in the world.
&lt;br /&gt;In closing on the likelihood of "disinformation" I'll say
what I told the loved ones that I left behind, and am even more
emphatic about after having spent the time at Basecamp and high on
K2, nothing is the case until it is the case. Meaning that even
though it might potentially be the case that I'm reported dead or
missing, don't start planning any funerals until everyone packs it
up for the season. There are many different routes that one could
find themselves struggling down-none of which are close to any
civilization. 
&lt;br /&gt;That being said, for those concerned about the potential
rescue of those climbers reported trapped above the Bottleneck on
K2. If the climbers cannot make it down to at least Camp 3 under
their own power it is unlikely that they will make it down at all.
For those on oxygen the race is even more intense as the effects of
altitude will be even more compounded on their ability to keep
their extremeties warm and their minds clear in order to make that
charge.
&lt;br /&gt;I wish everyone involved in the rescue efforts the best of
luck, I wish that I could be there to help. For those of you
praying for loved ones my thoughts are with you, but don't pray for
their survival alone they MUST make their way down to come home.

      <title>DEATH IN K2 MY STORY Ricardo Torres-Nava</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-55443?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>&lt;br /&gt;I was both climber and expedition head for the International
K2 expedition in 1992 with elite climbers from Mexico, Sweden and
New Zealand.
&lt;br /&gt;I am the first Mexican and Latin American to summit Mt.
Everest and to complete the Seven Summtis Grand Slam (double
version) and on that expedition were with me Gary Ball and Rob
Hall, top New Zealand mountaneers and on the sweedish side the two
first swedish who climb Mt. Everest amongst others.
&lt;br /&gt;My direct climbing partner was Adrian Benitez, one of
Mexico's top mountaneers and on summit day, August 14^th^, 1992 we
left camp 4 whilst the newzealanders, swedish and another mexican
stayed as they were feeling sick due to high altitude.
&lt;br /&gt;It was a difficult season weatherwise and our window of
opportunity was getting slimmer so Adrian and I left for the top
and when we were about 300 m from the summit an ice wall we were
climbing broke and Adrian fell 9000 ft to his death.
&lt;br /&gt;The last picture I took from us is here together with a
general view of K2 but from the chinese side wich I attempted on
1993 as part as an international expedition led by the russian
climber Valimir Baliverdin.
&lt;br /&gt;Adrian fell and I was left in the middle of a storm hanging
from a ledge, shuddering with panic and unable to move for a while.
&lt;br /&gt;It took me over two hours getting to a safer place where I
radioed to base camp with the unfortunate news.
&lt;br /&gt;With the base camp telescope, Adrian's body was located only
to disappear hours later due to the storm.
&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time I had no time to mourn as I had to aid in
the rescue of Gary Ball who had developed pulmonary and cerebral
edema on Camp 4 at above 8000 meters.
&lt;br /&gt;Bringing Gary down took us nearly four days due to bad
weather. Finally the rescue helicopter made the ride to Skardu from
where my wife, who had finish a very special ecological trek with 6
choice teenagers from Mexico, made the arrangements to airlift Gary
to the Polyclinic in Islamabad where Dr. Shaukat Malik, a top
cardiac surgeon was able to save his life.
&lt;br /&gt;The sad end of the story is that he later died in Daulaghiri
and Rob Hall, his climbing partner lost his life in 1996 during
that deadly Everest season recount by Jon Krakauer in "On thin
air".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;K2 is a killer mountain, the weather changes so quickly due
to its own microclimate that all weather forcasts sometimes prove
useless. Many people had lost their life there and sometimes in
unforseen circumstances as the italian climber Renato Casarotto who
fell to his death 500 ft away from base camp when an ice bridge
broke.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing lightly about climbing it , I have tried it
twice by the pakistani and chinese side and I had swore never to
try it again as some climbers get obsesed by its luring beauty. The
chances of dying against summiting and coming back alive are 3 to 1
so I really doubt that if there are missing people there, they
would be alive after a day.

      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-55297?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>The police have arrested a 35-year-old mentally disturbed man, who
was wandering in streets with the head of his companion, whom he
had beheaded at Vourvoulos, Santorini at 19:00. As per latest
evidence, the man killed his companion, who was a teacher, and then
beheaded her. Afterwards, he got out of the house and began
wandering in the streets. When the police tried to arrest him, the
culprit injured a police officer in the face with his knife.
Another police officer shot him four times on the legs and injured
him. However, the man managed to get into the police officers' car
and tried to escape. Later, other patrol cars blocked him. The
culprit swerved and hit two women doctors, who were riding their
motorcycle, injuring them seriously. The culprit and the two women
are to be transferred to KAT Hospital in Athens by plane.</description>

      <title>Tree vs Car</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-55334?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>It's really a cationary tale for others to be more careful while
driving in severe storms.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Marty was following his friend Elan in a minivan when the
wind blew a tree down right on Elan's car during a severe and
sudden thunderstorm.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Elan escaped without injury which is a miracle and, though
shaken up a bit, she was feeling VERY lucky.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Literally a split second and inches made all the difference!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This happened Saturday Aug. 2nd, 6;30pm est. right next to
the Ashokan Reservior in the Catskill Mountains, about ninety miles
north of NYC.</description>

      <description>Not sure what this girl was thinking in Mobile, Alabama last
Sunday! She had a whole tree in her car coming out of the roof and
all the windows! She was driving along like it was no big deal.</description>

      <description>F/V Monarch crewmember Rosie Pine, 20, unloads two 140-pound plus
halibut at the Norquest Seafoods dock in Petersburg Alaska Saturday
August 2. At this size halibut are believed to be over 30 years
old. Halibut prices are nearing the $5 per pound mark. The hard
work and good pay are reasons Pine, a Reed College (Portland)
biology major, is in her second year on the boat. "And eating
Yellow Eye rockfish, and halibut... yum," Pine stated. "The scenery
and wildlife here is incredible..whales along side the boat...
eagles... and we anchor places that most cruise ships don't see."</description>

      <description>For the past week, a section of the Bridger Teton National Forest
north west of Pinedale, Wyoming has been on fire. As of Friday, 200
firefighters were trying to contain the fire, which was started by
a campfire that got away from campers. These pictures were taken
Friday night as one part of the fire moved down the hills above New
Fork Lake.</description>
