The game seems to have been scrutinized recently by the press and also by the NeoGAF forum, I suspect because of several factors. One, it\'s been in development for a long time. You could say since the PS1 era, although such a claim is hardly fair. Too Human was an altogether different game back then. The title as it exists today was started on Xbox 360. Two, SK president Denis Dyack is an outspoken guy who has talked up the title. And when you talk something up, anything less than megatonian is bound to be a letdown. And three, Too Human was unfortunately shown in an extremely rough state at E3 2006, and SK has had to battle to overcome the perception that the title is incredibly flawed ever since. Thus, the scrutiny, which is practically unavoidable. Any hands-on update, my own included, would at this point have to touch upon, bare minimum, whether or not the game has delivered on its potential.\r<br /> \r<br /> I\'m officially 60 percent through the game after six hours. My character, a champion, is at level 22. However, Bozon and I played to the end of the title the other night with his character, a bio-engineer, so I\'ve now seen to the story\'s closure, too. \r<br /> \r<br /> Boz loves dungeon crawlers. He grew up on games like Diablo. On the other hand, I\'m not a big fan of the genre. I recognize the qualities of certain games belonging to it, but they haven\'t in the past generally appealed to me. In my mind, Too Human\'s biggest success is therefore that it makes me a believer in the genre. Control and combat are surprisingly tight and fun -- these two areas represented my biggest concerns going in, but they have really come together since the first time I saw the game in motion. The story is engaging. And the loot / character and weapon upgrade system is very deep and addictive.\r<br /> \r<br /> The game comes into its own as you acquire new loot and level-up your character. The modifications you make are represented instantly in-game and you can not only see the changes in menacing looking new weapons and gear, but feel them as well, as your guns and blades will drop enemies much quicker and your armor will protect you for longer periods of time. When you are significantly leveled up and sliding all over the screen in a flash, popping enemies into the air and holding them there with your guns, the game is downright intense, not to mention thoroughly satisfying. And when you stop to consider that it\'s a dungeon crawler, the combat is all the more  impressive, at least as far as I\'m concerned.\r<br /> \r<br /> The game\'s not perfect. I admire Silicon Knights\' attempt to simplify the experience with an automatic camera. I\'m all for that in the same way that I\'m for fewer open-world sandbox games and more linear, controlled experiences that can really shine. (I really hate the notion that bigger, freer worlds somehow inherently equate to better gameplay. If your world is big and boring, or big and clunky, how is that more fun? But I digress.) The problem is that while Too Human\'s camera sometimes enables some truly cinematic angles and experiences, it also occasionally fails to accurately predict where you want to go or look and it\'s during these moments that it can be intrusive. And that really is the right descriptor, for why the camera is sometimes a frustration, it is by no means a deal-breaker. And don\'t forget, it\'s because the camera is automatic that you have that second analog stick for combat, which is a great addition. \r<br /> \r<br /> I\'ve seen story brought up a lot by critics -- that the game is light on a good yarn. I wouldn\'t say that\'s true. By SK\'s own admission, the storyline in Too Human is much larger and deeper than it was in Eternal Darkness. Now, it\'s been awhile since I\'ve played through ED, but I seem to remember it featuring a pretty robust yarn. I think it\'s the way in which Too Human\'s storyline is delivered that has left some people wanting a little more, myself included. The game starts off with a lengthy cinematic that opens everything up, but further storyline cinematics are rendered almost entirely between levels, so you might go two or three hours through a &quot;dungeon&quot; without a major cinema. Doesn\'t mean there\'s not some considerable content, it just means that you\'ll be waiting for some of it.\r<br /> \r<br /> Despite these two potential issues, I really like Too Human and will be adding it to my game library when the time comes. I think it says something that I have officially played through 60 percent of the title with my champion character (and have separately seen it through to the end with Boz\'s bio-engineer) and am still eager to start over and try it with the berserker class, perfect for melee. As far as dungeon crawlers go, I have never felt compelled to stick a single one of them out. I haven\'t explored the online mode at all yet. I think that says something. If nothing else, Too Human has succeeded in bringing a loot-based experience to gamers who might be wary of one.\r<br /> \r<br /> I\'m sure there will be those out there who hate Too Human. I get the feeling some people actually want to hate it. But I really don\'t think the hate is warranted. There is no effin\' way in this life or the next Too Human can accurately be gauged a bad game. It\'s just not. Period. What it will boil down to, I think, is whether it\'s a great game or merely a good one.","PositiveVotes":26,"NegativeVotes":0,"Score":-1,"BoardID":8596,"Board":null,"Author":{"UserID":5026,"Name":"Matt-IGN","Title":"","IsBanned":false,"IsDisabled":false,"Style":"font-weight: bold; color: red;","IsAdministrator":false,"IsManager":false,"IsModerator":false,"IsVip":false,"IsModType":false,"PostCount":0,"VirtualPostCount":0,"NewPMCount":0,"IsSubscriber":false,"LastLoginDate":new Date(-59011459200000),"DateAdded":new Date(-59011459200000),"DateUpdated":new Date(-59011459200000),"LastPostDate":new Date(-59011459200000),"FavoriteBoards":[],"Icon":{"IconID":44058,"Alias":"CasaMIIsina","ImageURL":"ign.com_files/mattmii_1172210133.gif","Width":80,"Height":80},"WishListCount":0,"CollListCount":0,"WatchedByCount":0,"HasBlog":false,"TotalFriends":-1,"ViewingUserIsModType":false,"WatchedUsers":null,"PublicEmailAddress":"","Signature":""},"ForeignID":"748783","ObjectName":"Too Human","PostTypeName":"blogentry","BasePostTypeName":"","DatePosted":new Date(1215429692050),"LastActivity":new Date(-59011459200000),"LastActivityString":"July 07, 2008 11:21AM PST"},{"PostType":"review","ContentLocation":"http://readerreviews.ign.com/rrview/tv/metal_gear_solid_4_guns_of_the_patriots/714044/88067/","Title":"Its worth buying a PS3!","Snippet":null,"PositiveVotes":9,"NegativeVotes":4,"Score":10,"BoardID":-1,"Board":null,"Author":{"UserID":-1,"Name":"Statement87","Title":"","IsBanned":false,"IsDisabled":false,"Style":"","IsAdministrator":false,"IsManager":false,"IsModerator":false,"IsVip":false,"IsModType":false,"PostCount":0,"VirtualPostCount":0,"NewPMCount":0,"IsSubscriber":false,"LastLoginDate":new Date(-59011459200000),"DateAdded":new Date(-59011459200000),"DateUpdated":new Date(-59011459200000),"LastPostDate":new Date(-59011459200000),"FavoriteBoards":[],"Icon":{"IconID":-1,"Alias":null,"ImageURL":null,"Width":-1,"Height":-1},"WishListCount":0,"CollListCount":0,"WatchedByCount":0,"HasBlog":false,"TotalFriends":-1,"ViewingUserIsModType":false,"WatchedUsers":null,"PublicEmailAddress":"","Signature":""},"ForeignID":"714044","ObjectName":"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots ","PostTypeName":"readerreview","BasePostTypeName":"","DatePosted":new Date(1215439739123),"LastActivity":new Date(1215439739123),"LastActivityString":"July 07, 2008 2:08PM PST"},{"PostType":"wiki","ContentLocation":"http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/902/902590u.html","Title":"Quote for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare","Snippet":"Captain Price:  Gaz, can\'t you make it open faster?\nGaz: Negative, sir.
